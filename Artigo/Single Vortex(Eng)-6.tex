\begin{abstract}
Here we analyze the collective excitations as well as the expansion
of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate with a vortex line at its center.
To this end, we propose a variational method where the variational
parameters have to be carefully chosen in order to produce reliable
results. Our variational calculations agree with numerical simulations
of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The system considered here turns
out to exhibit four collective modes of which only three can be observed
at a time depending of the trap anisotropy. We also demonstrate that
these collective modes can be excited using well \textbf{established}
experimental methods such as modulation of the s-wave scattering length.

\section{Introduction}

{\indent}

In this work, we are interested in the dynamics of a trapped Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) containing a line vortex at its center. Here we are
particularly interested in obtaining the collective oscillation modes
of the system which couples the vortex core oscillations with the
oscillations of the condensate external dimensions. The interest in
this problem is motivated by the fact that these oscillations can
be measured in the laboratory by moving the atomic cloud out of its
equilibrium configuration by using the Feshbach resonance in order
to modulate the scattering length \cite{cm1,c-ex1,perez2,rev1,rev3}.
These oscillations are also studied in other physical systems such
as two-species condensates \cite{2-comp}, BCS-BEC crossover \cite{cm2,cm3,cm5},
and superfluid Helium \cite{cm4}. From the theoretical point of view,
we are \textbf{interested in} how the size of the vortex core oscillates
with respect to the external dimensions of the cloud. The mode with
the smallest oscillation frequency is the quadrupole mode which occurs
when the longitudinal and radial sizes of condensate oscillate out
phase. The breathing mode requires more energy to be excited since
the change in the density of the atomic cloud imposes a greater resistance
against deviation from its equilibrium configuration than in the case
of quadrupole excitations \cite{pethick,pit-str}.

\textbf{The frequency shifts of quadrupole oscillations due to the
presence of a singly charged vortex have been analytically explored
for positive scattering lengths using the sum-rule approach \cite{smv2}
as well as the effects of lower dimensional geometry on the frequency
splitting of quadrupole oscillations \cite{smv3}.}

In Refs. \cite{fetter1,vi2,sa-nomalmodes}, the dynamics of normal
modes for a single vortex has been studied using hydrodynamic models,
which focus on the vortex motion with respect to the center-of-mass
of the condensate. This concept was also used in the case of multicomponent
Bose-Einstein condensates \cite{2-compvor}\textbf{ as well as in
the description of the dynamics of single perturbed vortex lines \cite{smv4}.}

Preliminary calculations using a variational calculation with a Gaussian
Ansatz, which does not take into account the independent variation
of the vortex core size \cite{perez1,perez2,2-comp,2-compvor}, shows
a small shift in the frequencies of the aforementioned modes (Figure
\ref{fig1}). This shift has already been obtained via a hydrodynamic
approximation in Refs. \cite{pit-str} and \cite{normalmodes}.

Upper lines correspond the frequencies of the breathing mode as a

the frequencies of the quadrupole mode. Solid (black) lines correspond
to a vortex-free Gaussian-profile while dotted (blue) lines describe
a profile with a singly charged vortex. Note that $\varpi$ is normalized
by the frequency of the radial direction $\omega_{\rho}$.}


\label{fig1}
\end{figure}
 Thus we can expect the frequency of the monopole (breathing) mode
to decrease while the quadrupole frequency increases in the presence
of the vortex.

To calculate the dynamics of a vortex with charge $\ell$ in a more
consistent way with the physical reality, which allows for the coupling
between vortex core and the external dimensions of condensate, we
could naïvely use a Thomas-Fermi (TF) Ansatz \cite{vi1}
\begin{equation}
\psi\left(\rho,\varphi,z,t\right)=A\left(t\right)\left[\frac{\rho^{2}}{\rho^{2}+\xi\left(t\right)^{2}}\right]^{\mathbf{\frac{\ell}{2}}}\sqrt{1-\frac{\rho^{2}}{R_{\rho}\left(t\right)^{2}}-\frac{z^{2}}{R_{z}\left(t\right)^{2}}}\exp\left[i\ell\varphi+iB_{\rho}\left(t\right)\frac{\rho^{2}}{2}+iB_{z}\left(t\right)\frac{z^{2}}{2}\right],\label{eq:TF-A}
\end{equation}
\textbf{where $R_{\rho}(t)$ and $R_{z}(t)$ are the condensate sizes
in radial ($\hat{\rho}$) and axial ($\hat{z}$) directions, and $\xi(t)$
is the size of vortex core. The variational parameters $B_{\rho}(t)$
and $B_{z}(t)$ specify the variations of the velocity field }$\delta\mathbf{v}=B_{\rho}(t)\rho\hat{\rho}+B_{z}(t)z\hat{z}$.
\textbf{The next step is to} calculate the equations of motion for
the five variational parameters ($\xi$, $R_{\rho}$, $R_{z}$, $B_{\rho}$,
$B_{z}$). Following these calculations, the equations of motion would
be linearized. For the Ansatz (\ref{eq:TF-A}), this procedure leads
to imaginary frequencies which are not consistent with the stable
configuration where a singly charged ($\ell=1$) vortex resides at
the center of the condensate. The linearized equations of motion can
be written in a matrix form according to
\begin{equation}
M\ddot{\delta}+V\delta=0,\label{eq:2}
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is the vector with components given by deviations
of the variational parameters from their equilibrium values. The solution
of (\ref{eq:2}) is a linear combination of oscillatory modes whose
oscillation frequencies obey the equation 
\begin{equation}
\prod_{n}\varpi_{n}^{2}=\det\left(M^{-1}V\right)=\frac{\det V}{\det M}.\label{eq:w2}
\end{equation}


In order to ensure that all frequencies $\varpi_{n}$ are real, we
must have $\det V/\det M>0$. We know that $\det V>0$ since its sign
reflects the sign of the variational parameters which represents the
external dimensions of the cloud in the stationary situation. Therefore
$\det M$ must also be positive. In the case of Ansatz (\ref{eq:TF-A})
with $\ell=1$, such conditions are not satisfied since $\det M<0$,
which indicates that there is something wrong with Ansatz (\ref{eq:TF-A}).
In previous works \cite{2-compvor,michele,sa-nomalmodes,rpteles1},
since the authors did not consider the size of the vortex core as
a variational parameter, this problem did not appear. \textbf{More
specifically, the imaginary frequency problem arises for excitation
modes where the vortex core and the external size of the cloud oscillate
out of phase. This kind of motion generates a velocity field which
changes the sign of its radial component as the distance to the vortex
line is increased. Since the Ansatz (\ref{eq:TF-A}) describes only
linear variations of this component, it is natural to expect non-physical
results in this case. }

In Section II, the necessary requirements for the wave function phase
are discussed in order to give support to our variational method.
Section III has the calculation based on the new Ansatz and the corresponding
equations of motion are obtained. The collective modes considering
the coupling between vortex and atomic cloud are obtained via linearization
of the equations of motion, thus resulting in new collective oscillations
(section IV). In section V, we showed that such excitation modes can
be excited using the scattering length modulation. The free expansion
was also calculated in order to complement a previous work \cite{rpteles1}.
Finally, section VII contains the conclusions on our subject of study.


\section{Wave-function phase}

{\indent}

We start with the Lagrangian density,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=\frac{i\hbar}{2}\left(\psi^{*}\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}-\psi\frac{\partial\psi^{*}}{\partial t}\right)-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\left|\nabla\psi\right|^{2}-V\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\left|\psi\right|^{2}-\frac{g}{2}\left|\psi\right|^{4},\label{eq:2-1}
\end{equation}


whose extremization leads to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE):

\begin{equation}
i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}=\left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}+V\left(\mathbf{r}\right)+g\left|\psi\right|^{2}\right]\psi,
\end{equation}
where $V\left(\mathbf{r}\right)=\frac{1}{2}m\omega_{\rho}^{2}\left(\rho^{2}+\lambda^{2}z^{2}\right)$
is an external potential, the trap anisotropy is $\lambda=\omega_{z}/\omega_{\rho}$,
and $g$ is the coupling constant. The complex field $\psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)$
can be written as an amplitude profile multiplied by a respective
phase, as follows: 

\begin{equation}
\psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)=f\left(w_{l},\mathbf{r}\right)e^{iS\left(\chi_{l},\mathbf{r}\right)},\label{eq:2-2}
\end{equation}
where

\begin{equation}
S\left(\chi_{l},\mathbf{r}\right)=\ell\varphi+\sum_{l}\chi_{l}\phi_{l}(\mathbf{r}).\label{eq:2-3}
\end{equation}
We denoted both, $w_{l}=w_{l}\left(t\right)$ and $\chi_{l}=\chi_{l}\left(t\right)$,
respectively, as the amplitude and phase variational parameters. In
principle, $\left\{ \phi_{l}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\right\} $ should
be a complete set of functions but in our present approximation, we
use only a representative incomplete set of functions. Substituting
(\ref{eq:2-2}) and (\ref{eq:2-3}) into (\ref{eq:2-1}), the Lagrangian
$L=\int\mathcal{L}d^{3}\mathbf{r}$ becomes

\begin{equation}
L=-\hbar\sum_{l}\dot{\chi_{l}}\int d^{3}\mathbf{r}f^{2}\phi_{l}-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\sum_{l}\chi_{l}^{2}\int d^{3}\mathbf{r}f^{2}\left|\nabla\phi_{l}\right|^{2}-\int d^{3}\mathbf{r}\left(\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\left|\nabla f\right|^{2}+Vf^{2}+\frac{g}{2}f^{4}\right).
\end{equation}


In order to account for the dynamics of all three variational parameters
\textbf{($R_{\rho}$, $R_{z}$, and $\xi$)} in $f$ we include a
variational phase which also contains three variational parameters.
This way we chose the following trial function: 
\begin{equation}
S(\rho,z,t)=\ell\varphi+B_{\rho}(t)\frac{\rho^{2}}{2}+C(t)\frac{\rho^{4}}{4}+B_{z}(t)\frac{z^{2}}{2}.\label{eq:fase 2}
\end{equation}
\textbf{This allows the radial component of the velocity field to
change its sign for different distances to the symmetry axis of the
cloud.} As the superfluid current is connected to the density variation,
it is also desirable that both, amplitude and phase, have the same
number of variational parameters. \textbf{It is worth noticing that,
in principle, any other Ansatz allowing for such behavior of the velocity
field would be equaly valid. We chose to add an extra $\rho^{4}$
term to the wave-function phase due to its simplicity.} The Ansatz
(\ref{eq:fase 2}) also leads to linearized equations of motion (\ref{eq:2})
with $\det M>0$ which is consistent with the stability of the condensate
with a singly charged vortex at its center.


\section{Equations of motion}

{\indent}

Now we correct the Thomas-Fermi Ansatz according to the discussion
in section II. This leads to the following trial function:
\begin{align}
\psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)= & \sqrt{\frac{N}{R_{\rho}(t)^{2}R_{z}(t)A_{0}\left[\xi\left(t\right)/R_{\rho}\left(t\right)\right]}}\left[\frac{\rho^{2}}{\rho^{2}+\xi\left(t\right)^{2}}\right]^{\frac{\ell}{2}}\sqrt{1-\frac{\rho^{2}}{R_{\rho}\left(t\right)^{2}}-\frac{z^{2}}{R_{z}\left(t\right)^{2}}}\nonumber \\
 & \times\exp\left[i\ell\varphi+iB_{\rho}\left(t\right)\frac{\rho^{2}}{2}+iC(t)\frac{\rho^{4}}{4}+iB_{z}\left(t\right)\frac{z^{2}}{2}\right],\label{eq:NTF}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
A_{0}(\alpha)= & \frac{2\pi^{3/2}\left(\ell\right)!}{15\alpha^{2\ell}\left(\frac{3}{2}+\ell\right)!}\left[\left(3+2\ell\alpha^{2}\right){}_{2}F_{1}\left(\ell,1+\ell;\frac{5}{2}+\ell;-\frac{1}{\alpha^{2}}\right)\right.\nonumber \\
 & \left.-2\ell\left(1+\alpha^{2}\right){}_{2}F_{1}\left(1+\ell,1+\ell;\frac{5}{2}+\ell;-\frac{1}{\alpha^{2}}\right)\right],
\end{align}
where, for simplicity we define $\alpha\left(t\right)=\xi\left(t\right)/R_{\rho}\left(t\right)$,
$_{p}F_{q}\left(a_{1},\ldots,a_{p};b_{1},\ldots,b_{q};x\right)$ are
the hypergeometric functions, $\xi(t)$ is the size of the vortex
core, $R_{\rho}(t)$ is the condensate size in radial direction ($\hat{\rho}$),
and $R_{z}(t)$ is the condensate size in axial direction ($\hat{z}$).
The wave function (\ref{eq:NTF}) has integration domain defined by
$1-\frac{\rho^{2}}{R_{\rho}^{2}}-\frac{z^{2}}{R_{z}^{2}}\geq0$, where
the wave function is approximately an inverted parabola (TF-shape),
except for the central vortex. The trapping potential shape sets the
condensate dimensions. To organize our calculations, we split the
Lagrangian so that it is a sum $L=L_{time}+L_{kin}+L_{pot}+L_{int}$
of the following terms:
\begin{align}
L_{time}= & \frac{i\hbar}{2}\int d^{3}\mathbf{r}\left[\psi^{*}\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)\frac{\partial\psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)}{\partial t}-\psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)\frac{\partial\psi^{*}\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)}{\partial t}\right]\nonumber \\
= & -\frac{N\hbar}{2}\left(D_{1}\dot{B_{\rho}}R_{\rho}^{2}+D_{2}\dot{B_{z}}R_{z}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}D_{3}\dot{C}R_{\rho}^{4}\right),\\
L_{kin}= & -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\int d^{3}\mathbf{r}\left[\nabla\psi^{*}\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)\right]\left[\nabla\psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)\right]\nonumber \\
= & -\frac{N\hbar^{2}}{2m}\left[D_{1}B_{\rho}^{2}R_{\rho}^{2}+D_{2}B_{z}^{2}R_{z}^{2}+2D_{3}B_{\rho}CR_{\rho}^{4}+R_{\rho}^{-2}\left(\ell^{2}D_{4}+D_{5}\right)+D_{6}C^{2}R_{\rho}^{6}\right],\\
L_{pot}= & -\frac{1}{2}m\omega_{\rho}^{2}\int d^{3}\mathbf{r}\left(\rho^{2}+\lambda^{2}z^{2}\right)\psi^{*}\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)\psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)\nonumber \\
= & -\frac{N}{2}m\omega_{\rho}^{2}\left(D_{1}R_{\rho}^{2}+\lambda^{2}D_{2}R_{z}^{2}\right),\\
L_{int}= & -\frac{g}{2}\int d^{3}\mathbf{r}\left[\psi^{*}\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)\psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)\right]^{2}\nonumber \\
= & -\frac{N^{2}gD_{7}}{2R_{\rho}^{2}R_{z}},
\end{align}
with the functions $D_{i}\left(\alpha\right)$ given by
\begin{align}
D_{1}\left(\alpha\right)= & A_{0}\left(\alpha\right)^{-1}\frac{2\pi^{3/2}\left(1+\ell\right)!}{21\alpha^{2\ell}\left(\frac{5}{2}+\ell\right)!}\left[\left(3+2\ell\alpha^{2}\right){}_{2}F_{1}\left(\ell,2+\ell;\frac{7}{2}+\ell;-\frac{1}{\alpha^{2}}\right)\right.\nonumber \\

D_{2}\left(\alpha\right)= & A_{0}\left(\alpha\right)^{-1}\frac{\pi^{3/2}\left(\ell\right)!}{4\alpha^{2\ell}\left(\frac{7}{2}+\ell\right)!}\left[\left(7+2\ell\right){}_{2}F_{1}\left(\ell,1+\ell;\frac{7}{2}+\ell;-\frac{1}{\alpha^{2}}\right)\right.\nonumber \\

D_{5}\left(\alpha\right)= & A_{0}\left(\alpha\right)^{-1}\frac{2\pi^{3/2}\left(\ell-1\right)!}{9\alpha^{2\ell}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\ell\right)!}\left[\left(3+2\ell\alpha^{2}\right){}_{2}F_{1}\left(\ell,\ell;\frac{3}{2}+\ell;-\alpha^{2}\right)\right.\nonumber \\
 & \left.-2\ell\left(1+\alpha^{2}\right){}_{2}F_{1}\left(\ell,1+\ell;\frac{3}{2}+\ell;-\frac{1}{\alpha^{2}}\right)\right],\\
D_{6}\left(\alpha\right)= & A_{0}\left(\alpha\right)^{-1}\frac{2\pi^{3/2}\left(3+\ell\right)!}{33\alpha^{2\ell}\left(\frac{9}{2}+\ell\right)!}\left[\left(3+2\ell\alpha^{2}\right){}_{2}F_{1}\left(\ell,4+\ell;\frac{11}{2}+\ell;-\frac{1}{\alpha^{2}}\right)\right.\nonumber \\

\end{align}
For simplicity we can scale the variational parameters of the Lagrangian
as well as the time in order to make them dimensionless,
\begin{align*}
R_{\rho}(t)\rightarrow & a_{osc}r_{\rho}(t),\\
R_{z}(t)\rightarrow & a_{osc}r_{z}(t),\\
\xi(t)\rightarrow & a_{osc}r_{\xi}(t),\\
B_{\rho}(t)\rightarrow & a_{osc}^{-2}\beta_{\rho}(t),\\
B_{z}(t)\rightarrow & a_{osc}^{-2}\beta_{z}(t),\\
C(t)\rightarrow & a_{osc}^{-4}\zeta(t),\\
t\rightarrow & \omega_{\rho}^{-1}\tau,
\end{align*}
where the harmonic oscillator length is $a_{osc}=\sqrt{\hbar/m\omega_{\rho}}$
and the dimensionless interaction parameter is $\gamma=Na_{s}/a_{osc}$.
Thus the Lagrangian becomes
\begin{align}
L= & -\frac{N\hbar\omega_{\rho}}{2}\left[D_{1}r_{\rho}^{2}\left(\dot{\beta_{\rho}}+\beta_{\rho}^{2}+1\right)+D_{2}r_{z}^{2}\left(\dot{\beta_{z}}+\beta_{z}^{2}+\lambda^{2}\right)\right.\nonumber \\
 & \left.+D_{3}r_{\rho}^{4}\left(\frac{1}{2}\dot{\zeta}+2\beta_{\rho}\zeta\right)+\ell^{2}r_{\rho}^{-2}\left(D_{4}+D_{5}\right)+D_{6}\zeta^{2}r_{\rho}^{6}+D_{7}\frac{4\pi\gamma}{r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}}\right].\label{eq:Lagrangian}
\end{align}
The Euler-Lagrange equations
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q_{i}}}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_{i}}= & 0,
\end{align}
for each one of the six variational parameters from Lagrangian (\ref{eq:Lagrangian})
lead to the six differential equations:
\begin{align}
\beta_{\rho}-\frac{\dot{r_{\rho}}}{r_{\rho}}-\frac{D_{1}^{\prime}\dot{\alpha}}{2D_{1}}+\frac{D_{3}r_{\rho}^{2}\zeta}{D_{1}} & =0,\label{eq:1a}\\
\beta_{z}-\frac{\dot{r_{z}}}{r_{z}}-\frac{D_{2}^{\prime}\dot{\alpha}}{2D_{2}} & =0,\label{eq:1b}\\
\zeta-\frac{D_{3}\dot{r_{\rho}}}{D_{6}r_{\rho}}-\frac{D_{3}\dot{\alpha}}{4D_{6}r_{\rho}^{2}}+\frac{D_{3}\beta_{\rho}}{D_{6}r_{\rho}^{2}} & =0,\label{eq:1c}\\
D_{1}r_{\rho}\left(\dot{\beta_{\rho}}+\beta_{\rho}^{2}+1\right)+D_{3}r_{\rho}^{3}\left(\dot{\zeta}+4\beta_{\rho}\zeta\right)-\nonumber \\
\frac{\ell^{2}}{r_{\rho}^{3}}\left(D_{4}+D_{5}\right)+3D_{6}\zeta^{2}r_{\rho}^{5}-D_{7}\frac{4\pi\gamma}{r_{\rho}^{3}r_{z}} & =0,\label{eq:1d}\\
D_{2}r_{z}\left(\dot{\beta_{z}}+\beta_{z}^{2}+\lambda^{2}\right)-D_{7}\frac{2\pi\gamma}{r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}^{2}} & =0,\label{eq:1e}\\
D_{1}^{\prime}r_{\rho}^{2}\left(\dot{\beta_{\rho}}+\beta_{\rho}^{2}+1\right)+D_{2}^{\prime}r_{z}^{2}\left(\dot{\beta_{z}}+\beta_{z}^{2}+\lambda^{2}\right)+D_{3}^{\prime}r_{\rho}^{4}\left(\frac{1}{2}\dot{\zeta}+2\beta_{\rho}\zeta\right)+\nonumber \\
\frac{\ell^{2}}{r_{\rho}^{2}}\left(D_{4}^{\prime}+D_{5}^{\prime}\right)+D_{6}^{\prime}\zeta^{2}r_{\rho}^{6}-D_{7}^{\prime}\frac{4\pi\gamma}{r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}} & =0.\label{eq:1f}
\end{align}
 {\indent}

Solving these equations for the parameters in the wave function phase,
we have:
\begin{align}
\beta_{\rho}= & \frac{\dot{r_{\rho}}}{r_{\rho}}+F_{1}\dot{\alpha},\label{eq:2a}\\
\beta_{z}= & \frac{\dot{r_{z}}}{r_{z}}+F_{2}\dot{\alpha},\label{eq:2b}\\
\zeta= & F_{3}\frac{\dot{\alpha}}{r_{\rho}^{2}},\label{eq:2c}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
F_{1}= & \frac{D_{3}^{\prime}D_{3}-2D_{1}^{\prime}D_{6}}{4\left(D_{3}^{2}-D_{1}D_{6}\right)},\\
F_{2}= & \frac{D_{2}^{\prime}}{2D_{2}},\\
F_{3}= & \frac{2D_{1}^{\prime}D_{3}-D_{1}D_{3}^{\prime}}{4\left(D_{3}^{2}-D_{1}D_{6}\right)}.
\end{align}
Replacing (\ref{eq:2a}), (\ref{eq:2b}), and (\ref{eq:2c}) into
equations (\ref{eq:1d}), (\ref{eq:1e}), and (\ref{eq:1f}), we reduce
our six coupled equations to only three, which are given by:
\begin{align}
D_{1}\left(\ddot{r_{\rho}}+r_{\rho}\right)+G_{1}r_{\rho}\ddot{\alpha}+G_{2}r_{\rho}\dot{\alpha}^{2}+G_{3}\dot{r_{\rho}}\dot{\alpha}-G_{4}\frac{\ell^{2}}{r_{\rho}^{3}}-D_{7}\frac{4\pi\gamma}{r_{\rho}^{3}r_{z}} & =0,\label{eq:2d}\\
D_{2}\left(\ddot{r_{z}}+\lambda^{2}r_{z}\right)+G_{5}r_{z}\ddot{\alpha}+G_{6}r_{z}\dot{\alpha}^{2}+G_{7}\dot{r_{z}}\dot{\alpha}-D_{7}\frac{2\pi\gamma}{r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}^{2}} & =0,\label{eq:2e}\\
D_{1}^{\prime}r_{\rho}\left(\ddot{r_{\rho}}+r_{\rho}\right)+D_{2}^{\prime}r_{z}\left(\ddot{r_{z}}+\lambda^{2}r_{z}\right)+\left(G_{8}r_{\rho}^{2}+G_{9}r_{z}^{2}\right)\ddot{\alpha}+\left(G_{10}r_{\rho}^{2}+G_{11}r_{z}^{2}\right)\dot{\alpha}^{2}\nonumber \\
+\left(G_{12}r_{\rho}\dot{r_{\rho}}+G_{13}r_{z}\dot{r_{z}}\right)\dot{\alpha}+G_{14}\frac{\ell^{2}}{r_{\rho}^{2}}+D_{7}^{\prime}\frac{4\pi\gamma}{r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}} & =0,\label{eq:2f}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
G_{1}= & D_{1}F_{1}+D_{3}F_{3},\\
G_{2}= & D_{1}\left(F_{1}^{2}+F_{1}^{\prime}\right)+D_{3}\left(4F_{1}F_{3}+F_{3}^{\prime}\right)+3D_{6}F_{3}^{2},\\
G_{3}= & 2\left(D_{1}F_{1}+D_{3}F_{3}\right)=2G_{1},\\
G_{4}= & D_{4}+D_{5},\\
G_{5}= & D_{2}F_{2},\\

G_{7}= & 2D_{2}F_{2}=2G_{5},\\
G_{8}= & D_{1}^{\prime}F_{1}+\frac{1}{2}D_{3}^{\prime}F_{3},\\
G_{9}= & D_{2}^{\prime}F_{2},\\
G_{10}= & D_{1}^{\prime}\left(F_{1}^{2}+F_{1}^{\prime}\right)+D_{3}^{\prime}\left(\frac{1}{2}F_{3}^{\prime}+2F_{1}F_{3}\right)+D_{6}^{\prime}F_{3}^{2},\\

\end{align}
The terms $D_{1}r_{\rho}$, $D_{2}\lambda^{2}r_{z}$, $D_{1}^{\prime}r_{\rho}^{2}$,
and $D_{2}^{\prime}r_{z}^{2}$ come from the trapping term $L_{pot}$,
which can be neglected in the case of a freely expanding condensate.
The parameter $\gamma$ indicates the terms generated by the atomic
interaction potential, while the fractions proportional to $r_{\rho}^{-2}$
and $r_{\rho}^{-3}$ come from the kinetic energy contribution due
to the presence of the vortex with charge $\ell$. The remaining factors
represent the coupling between the outer dimensions of the condensate
and the vortex core.

Making the velocities ($\dot{r_{\rho}}$, $\dot{r_{z}}$ ,$\dot{\alpha}$)
and accelerations ($\ddot{r_{\rho}}$, $\ddot{r_{z}}$, $\ddot{\alpha}$)
equal to zero leads to the equations for the stationary solution:
\begin{align}
D_{1}r_{\rho0} & =G_{4}\frac{\ell^{2}}{r_{\rho0}^{3}}+D_{7}\frac{4\pi\gamma}{r_{\rho0}^{3}r_{z0}},\label{eq:ss1}\\
D_{2}\lambda^{2}r_{z0} & =D_{7}\frac{2\pi\gamma}{r_{\rho0}^{2}r_{z0}^{2}},\label{eq:ss2}\\
D_{1}^{\prime}r_{\rho0}^{2}+D_{2}^{\prime}\lambda^{2}r_{z0}^{2} & =-G_{14}\frac{\ell^{2}}{r_{\rho0}^{2}}-D_{7}^{\prime}\frac{4\pi\gamma}{r_{\rho0}^{2}r_{z0}},\label{eq:ss3}
\end{align}
where $r_{\rho}$, $r_{z}$, and $r_{\xi}$ take their respective
equilibrium values $r_{\rho0}$, $r_{z0}$, and $r_{\xi0}$. We apply
the Newton's method to solve the coupled stationary equations (\ref{eq:ss1})--(\ref{eq:ss3}).
The value of the atomic interaction parameter used from now on in
this paper is $\gamma=800$, which is close to the value used in Rubidium
experiments \cite{emanuel}.


\section{Collective excitations}

{\indent}

For small deviations from the equilibrium configuration, we assume
$r_{\rho}\left(t\right)\rightarrow r_{\rho0}+\delta\rho\left(t\right)$,
$r_{z}\left(t\right)\rightarrow r_{z0}+\delta z\left(t\right)$, $\alpha\left(t\right)\rightarrow\alpha_{0}+\delta\alpha\left(t\right)$,
and neglect all terms of order two or higher in (\ref{eq:2d})--(\ref{eq:2f}).
This leads to the linearized matrix equation
\begin{eqnarray}
 &  & \!\!\begin{pmatrix}D_{1} & 0 & G_{1}r_{\rho0}\\
0 & D_{2} & G_{5}r_{z0}\\

\end{eqnarray}
which defines the matrices $M$ and $V$, appearing in Eq.(\ref{eq:2}).
Solving the characteristic equation,
\begin{equation}
\det\left(M^{-1}V-\varpi^{2}I\right)=0,\label{eq:55}
\end{equation}
results in the frequencies of the collective modes of oscillation.
Now the determinants $\det M$ and $\det V$ are both positive for
$\ell=1$. \textbf{This means that a trapped condensate with a central
singly-charged vortex is described by a stable state}.

\label{figN}
\end{figure}
 Since (\ref{eq:55}) is a cubic equation of $\varpi^{2}$, we have
three pair of frequencies $\pm\varpi_{n}$ ($n=z,\rho,\xi$). There
are three frequencies $\varpi_{n}$ and four modes of oscillation
in total, of which only three modes can be simultaneously observed
depending on the anisotropy $\lambda$ of harmonic potential as shown
in fig.\ref{fig4}. Among these four modes, two of them represent
monopole oscillations while the other two represent quadrupole oscillations
of the atomic cloud. The $B_{1}$ mode (fig.\ref{figM-1}) is characterized
by having all condensate components $r_{i}$ ($i=z,\rho,\xi$) oscillating
in phase, however $B_{2}$ mode (fig.\ref{figM-3}) presents $r_{\xi}$
oscillating out of phase with $r_{\rho}$ and $r_{z}$. The $Q_{1}$
mode (fig.\ref{figM-2}) shows that $r_{z}$ oscillation is out of
phase with $r_{\xi}$ and $r_{\rho}$, which are in phase with each
other. However, in $Q_{2}$ mode (fig.\ref{figM-4}) the oscillations
of $r_{z}$ and $r_{\xi}$ are in phase with each other, being the
$r_{\rho}$ oscillation out of phase. Extrapolating to an ideal situation
where $\gamma=0$, the equations of motions (\ref{eq:2d})--(\ref{eq:2f})
can be decoupled. This way, the $\varpi_{z}$ (lower frequency) represents
only a $r_{z}$ oscillation, $\varpi_{\rho}$ (middle frequency) represents
only a $r_{\rho}$ oscillation, and $\varpi_{\xi}$ (upper frequency)
represents only a $r_{\xi}$ oscillation.

Numerical simulations where performed in order to validate our results
(fig.\ref{figN}). Frequency values $\varpi_{n}$ in the variational
calculations differ from numerical values by less than 1\%. 

In fig.\ref{fig4a}, for $0.1\leq\lambda\leq1$, exist two $Q_{2}$-like
modes. The difference between them comes from the fact that vortex
core oscillation amplitude which is two orders of magnitude lower
at the less energetic mode. The same happens when $\ell=2$ (fig.\ref{fig4b}),
i.e., the vortex core is almost still for the lower frequency in the
same interval of $\lambda$.

The solid lines in fig.\ref{fig4} correspond to the mode with largest
amplitude for the vortex-core oscillations. As can be seen, the excitation
frequency $\varpi_{\xi}$ of this mode lowers as the vortex circulation
increases. It means that the energy necessary to excite it will be
lower if $\ell$ is increased. However, we must point out that our
results apply only for the cases where $r_{\xi}\ll r_{\rho}$.


\section{Scattering length modulation}

{\indent}

One of the mechanisms used for exciting collective modes is via modulation
of the s-wave scattering length. This technique has been already applied
to excite the lowest-lying quadrupole mode in a Lithium experiment
\cite{cm1}. Therefore, we consider the time-dependent scattering
length:
\begin{equation}
a_{s}(t)=a_{0}+\delta a\cos\left(\Omega t\right).
\end{equation}
This is equivalent to make $\gamma\rightarrow\gamma(\tau)$, thus
giving:
\begin{equation}
\gamma(\tau)=\gamma_{0}+\delta\gamma\cos\left(\Omega\tau\right).\label{eq:slm}
\end{equation}
Where $\gamma_{0}$ is the average value of the interaction parameter
$\gamma\left(\tau\right)$, $\delta\gamma$ is the modulation amplitude,
and $\Omega$ is the excitation frequency. Substituting (\ref{eq:slm})
into (\ref{eq:3abc}) and keeping only first-order terms ($\delta\rho$,
$\delta z$, $\delta\alpha$, and $\delta\gamma$), we obtain a nonhomogeneous
linear equation

\begin{equation}
M\ddot{\delta}+V\delta=P\cos\left(\Omega\tau\right)\label{eq:modula=0000E7=0000E3o}
\end{equation}


with
\begin{equation}
P=2\pi\delta\gamma\begin{pmatrix}\frac{2D_{7}}{r_{\rho0}^{3}r_{z0}}\\
\frac{D_{7}}{r_{\rho0}^{2}r_{z0}^{2}}\\
\frac{D_{7}^{\prime}}{r_{\rho0}^{2}r_{z0}}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}


A particular solution of (\ref{eq:modula=0000E7=0000E3o}) is

\begin{equation}
\delta_{\gamma}\left(\tau\right)=\left(M^{-1}V-\Omega^{2}\right)^{-1}M^{-1}P\cos\left(\Omega\tau\right).
\end{equation}


Projecting the vector $\delta_{\gamma}\left(\tau\right)$ in the base
$\delta_{n}$ ($n=z,\rho,\xi$) of the eigenvectors of the homogenous
equation associated to Eq.(\ref{eq:modula=0000E7=0000E3o}), we obtain

\begin{equation}
\left\langle \delta_{n}|\delta_{\gamma}\left(\tau\right)\right\rangle =\frac{\left\langle \delta_{n}|M^{-1}P\right\rangle }{\varpi_{n}^{2}-\Omega^{2}}\cos\left(\Omega\tau\right).\label{eq:ngama}
\end{equation}


Since\textbf{ the scalar product $\left|\left\langle \delta_{n}|M^{-1}P\right\rangle \right|$
is always positive}, it shows that specific collective modes can be
excited using a scattering length modulation with small amplitude
$\delta\gamma$ and frequency $\Omega$ close to one of the resonance
frequency $\varpi_{n}$. In fig.\ref{fig5}, we see the results from
a numerical solution of Eqs.(\ref{eq:2d})--(\ref{eq:2f}) considering
a time-dependent interaction $\gamma\left(\tau\right)$ according
to Eq.(\ref{eq:slm}). There we can see the beat behavior corresponding
to a superposition of the frequencies $\Omega=6$ and $\varpi_{\xi}=6.13$.

from variational calculation, where $\varpi_{\xi}\approx6.13$ is

cigar shape ($\lambda=0.1$, $\gamma_{0}=800$) via scattering modulation

\label{fig7}
\end{figure}


The time-of-flight pictures constitute the most common method to measure
vortices in BEC. This method of switch off the magneto-optical trap
and letting atomic cloud expand freely for some time, typically ten
milliseconds and then taking a picture of the expanded cloud \cite{rev3,MIT,obv,turb,vor1,vp}.
For this purpose we use the equations of motion (\ref{eq:2d})--(\ref{eq:2f})
without the terms arising from the harmonic potential, i.e.,
\begin{align}
D_{1}\ddot{r_{\rho}}+G_{1}r_{\rho}\ddot{\alpha}+G_{2}r_{\rho}\dot{\alpha}^{2}+G_{3}\dot{r_{\rho}}\dot{\alpha}-G_{4}\frac{\ell^{2}}{r_{\rho}^{3}}-\frac{4D_{7}\gamma}{r_{\rho}^{3}r_{z}} & =0,\\
D_{2}\ddot{r_{z}}+G_{5}r_{z}\ddot{\alpha}+G_{6}r_{z}\dot{\alpha}^{2}+G_{7}\dot{r_{z}}\dot{\alpha}-\frac{2D_{7}\gamma}{r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}^{2}} & =0,\\
D_{1}^{\prime}r_{\rho}\ddot{r_{\rho}}+D_{2}^{\prime}r_{z}\ddot{r_{z}}+\left(G_{8}r_{\rho}^{2}+G_{9}r_{z}^{2}\right)\ddot{\alpha}+\left(G_{10}r_{\rho}^{2}+G_{11}r_{z}^{2}\right)\dot{\alpha}^{2}\nonumber \\
+\left(G_{12}r_{\rho}\dot{r_{\rho}}+G_{13}r_{z}\dot{r_{z}}\right)\dot{\alpha}+G_{14}\frac{\ell^{2}}{r_{\rho}^{3}}+\frac{4D_{7}^{\prime}\gamma}{r_{\rho}^{2}r_{z}} & =0,
\end{align}
whose initial conditions are given by the stationary equations (\ref{eq:ss1})--(\ref{eq:ss3}). 

\textbf{In fig. \ref{fig7}, we have the ratio between vortex core
size ($r_{\xi}$$)$ and radial cloud size ($r_{\rho}$) during free
expansion for three different initial trap configurations. In general,
the vortex core expands faster than the condensate at early times,
going to the same rate of expansion at large times. The prolate condensate
($\lambda=0.1$) has an almost constant the ratio $r_{\xi}/r_{\rho}$
during the entire expansion. For the isotropic ($\lambda=1$) and
oblate ($\lambda=8$) cases, this ratio increases rapidly in the initial
stage of the expansion until it converges to a constant value. These
results agree with our previous work \cite{rpteles1}, where fig.\ref{fig7b}
could not be calculated since the authors considered the healing length
as an approximation to the vortex core radius which is only valid
for $\ell=1$. Such an agreement indicates the fact that indeed the
vortex core size is always close to the instantaneous healing length
during the expansion. Moreover, since the radial component of the
velocity field always points outwards the cloud, the extra $\rho^{4}$
term in the wavefunction phase is not necessary for a consistent description
of the system.}


\section{Conclusions}

{\indent}

In this paper we proposed a modification in the wave function phase
commonly used with the variational method which corrects the imaginary
frequencies of collective modes when we have a parameter describing
non-physical vortex core dynamics with $\ell=1$.

Here we consider variational phase parameters corresponding to each
parameter in wave function amplitude, respectively. This way, we were
able to describe the dynamics of both vortex core and the external
dimensions of the condensate which agrees with the numerical simulations
of the GPE. Although we observe four modes of oscillation in total,
only three of them can be simultaneously observed depending on the
trap anisotropy.

We also demonstrate that these oscillation modes can be excited by
modulating the s-wave scattering length using the same experimental
techniques as in Ref. \cite{cm1}.

Finally, we analyzed the time-of-flight dynamics of the vortex core
with different circulations in order to complement the results in
Ref. \cite{rpteles1}.
