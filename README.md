Repository of the following research:

We analyze the collective excitations as well as the expansion of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate with a vortex line at its center. To this end, we propose a variational method where the variational parameters have to be carefully chosen in order to produce reliable results. Our variational calculations agree with numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The system considered here turns out to exhibit four collective modes of which only three can be observed at a time depending on the trap anisotropy. We also demonstrate that these collective modes can be excited using well established experimental methods such as modulation of the s-wave scattering length.
